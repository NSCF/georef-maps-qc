### Georeference Maps Quality Control

This is a script for generating maps of a collectors records by date after georeferencing for quality control purposes. After generating the maps open the first in an image viewer and scroll through the maps to find outlying records. 

To run the script `openMaps.py` and set the `csv_name` variable to point to your csv file, and `maps_dir` to a directory where the maps will be stored. Then run the script with Python.
